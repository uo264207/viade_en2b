== Cross-cutting Concepts

.Introduction
As this project does not have a properly said database(using sql for example) we will use the pods as the database storing the different data as files with a the format decided as the standard, which in the lasts weeks at least regarding both groups of our lab is storing data in jsonld file in the pod.

.Architecture
Right now our project has a more or less layered architecture as we tried to divide the project in the presentation layer and logic layer having an intemidiate layer to interact between the two.

.Technical decisions
As the project advanced we decided several things that affected the project in one way or another here are some decisions that we made.

* Decide to use jsonld as the file to save the data.
* Decide to create a route in real time while the user is doing it as all the team members
decided that it makes sense to do it this way.

.Modules and libraries
We used several modules/libraries that made several of the funcionalities possible and without them it would have been impossible for us to develop them, some of the libraries/modules are listed and explained next.

* solid-auth-client : use the login system most of the time
* solid-file-client : get and upload files from/to the pods
* react-router-dom : use a lot of things as redirects and assigning components to a url from react
* react-toastify : implement notifications
* google-maps-react : show the routes in the map
* @solid/react : use ldflex to get user info
* jest-cucumber : for testing
* jest-puppeteer : for testing

.Not Yet Implemented
As there is no final decisions about anything at the moment that belongs to this category because the development of the app hasn´t started yet, so there is not much to put in this category for now, but it will be updated as the project goes on.
I haven´t erased the examples of this document to take a look to them when it is really needed in the near future.

.Content
This section describes overall, principal regulations and solution ideas that are
relevant in multiple parts (= cross-cutting) of your system.
Such concepts are often related to multiple building blocks.
They can include many different topics, such as

* domain models
* architecture patterns or design patterns
* rules for using specific technology
* principal, often technical decisions of overall decisions
* implementation rules

.Motivation
Concepts form the basis for _conceptual integrity_ (consistency, homogeneity)
of the architecture. Thus, they are an important contribution to achieve inner qualities of your system.

Some of these concepts cannot be assigned to individual building blocks
(e.g. security or safety). This is the place in the template that we provided for a
cohesive specification of such concepts.

.Form
The form can be varied:

* concept papers with any kind of structure
* cross-cutting model excerpts or scenarios using notations of the architecture views
* sample implementations, especially for technical concepts
* reference to typical usage of standard frameworks (e.g. using Hibernate for object/relational mapping)

.Structure
A potential (but not mandatory) structure for this section could be:

* Domain concepts
* User Experience concepts (UX)
* Safety and security concepts
* Architecture and design patterns
* "Under-the-hood"
* development concepts
* operational concepts

Note: it might be difficult to assign individual concepts to one specific topic
on this list.
